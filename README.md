## Pick-A-Meetup-usingNextJS

I constructed this real-world  project  to help users create a mutually agreed upon meeting point with pictures and the address of the location.

Users can spark curiosity in interesting things around the meetup.  

The project saves geographic location for easy input into route planning software.

It utilizes MongoDB Atlas for partial CRUD operations.   

The project was built with React as a framework using NextJs and deployed with Vercel.
